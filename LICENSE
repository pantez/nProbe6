This file describes the terms under which nProbe is distributed.

/* ************** IMPORTANT PLEASE READ ************** */

nProbe is (C) 2002-14 by Luca Deri <deri@ntop.org> that is
distributed under GNU GPL who owns the nProbe intellectual property
and copyright (beside the sFlow collector code).

If you wish to integrate or embed nProbe into a proprietary software
or an embedded software/hardware solution such as the nBox, be
aware that we offer alternative licenses that allow you to do that.
Please contact license@ntop.org.

GPL requires that any work derived from a GPL licensed work
(as nProbe) must also be distributed under GPL. As the term
"derivative work" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work)
is not entirely clear we want to clarify this concept in the case of
nProbe. We consider a derivated work of nProbe for the purpose of
this license if it does any of the following:
- Integrates (even partially) nProbe source code
- Includes (even partially) nProbe copyrighted data files
- Integrates/embeds nProbe into a binary installer/application
- Includes the nProbe into an appliance, router or similar device
- Links (even through nProbe's plugins) to a library that is not
  available under GPL
- Executes nProbe and uses the produced results (usually flows
  either on the network, disk or database)

Note that the list applies to both nProbe "as a whole" and also
to portions of it. The above list is not exhaustive but it's
used to clarify the term derivative work with respect to nProbe.
This means that:
- nothing prevents you from distributing a proprietary product
  (either appliance, GUI front-end, or application) based on
  nProbe. Just sell/distribute it *without* nProbe, and point
  your customers to http://www.ntop.org/products/nprobe/ in order
  to have access to nProbe.
- you cannot include nProbe into a non-GPL derivative work.

Note that the above is a clarification of what we mean for
"derivative work" in the scope of the GPL-licensed nProbe.
This interpretation applies only to nProbe and not to any
other GPL products.

if you have questions about nProbe licensing please
contact license@ntop.org

See COPYING and EULA files for more details.

Note that the EULA applies *only* to nProbe derived work.
